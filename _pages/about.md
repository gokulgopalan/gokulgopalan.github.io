I am a third year PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Warwick. My research is on panel data econometrics with focus on methodological improvements and their applications in finance and macroeconomics. I am funded by the Economic and Social Research Coucil's MGS Fellowship.

Before I started my PhD, I spent close to a decade in public service in the [Indian Administrative Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Administrative_Service). During this period, I held leadership roles in designing and executing economic policies. These roles included the Chief Executive of a [district](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_magistrate) with a population of 1.1 million and Acting Secretary to the Government of Kerala, India in the Finance Department. 

I have a Masters in Public Affairs from Princeton University, where I was a Karl E. Prickett Fellow in Public and International Affairs.

I enjoy learning about economic and political history, especially the 18th and 19th centuries, visiting museums, running, and playing football. My favourite podcasts are [The Age of Napoleon](https://ageofnapoleon.com) and [The Fall of Civilizations](https://fallofcivilizationspodcast.com).

Find book reviews and commentaries on interesting new papers in my [blog](/blog/).
